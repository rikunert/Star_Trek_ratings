# Star_Trek_ratings
A python based analysis of Star Trek episodes and movies using mostly IMDb ratings via the IMDb API

# Data acquisition
Data acquisition proceeds separately for Star Trek series and movie. 
The episode data is acquired using the script imdb_STS_data_acquisition.py .
The movie data is acquired within the script imdb_STF.py .

# Data analysis and visualisation
Data visualisation is mostly matplotlib based and handled in imdb_STS_analysis.py for series and in imdb_STF.py for movies.

# Publication
The series data is unpublished as of this date. The movie data has been published on my data science blog Rich Data [here](http://rikunert.com/2017/05/11/star-trek-movies-ratings/).
